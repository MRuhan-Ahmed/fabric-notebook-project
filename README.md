# Microsoft Fabric: Excel Data Normalization with Notebooks

This project uses Microsoft Fabric's built-in notebooks to transform and normalize raw Excel sales data into structured tables for analysis and reporting.

## üß∞ Tools Used

- Microsoft Fabric Notebooks
- Python (Pandas)
- Excel (raw input files)

## üìÅ Project Overview

The notebook combines and cleans three monthly Excel order files (Jan‚ÄìMar) and a separate sales summary sheet. The result is a set of normalized tables:

- `bookings`
- `customers`
- `items`
- `sales`

All transformations were done using Pandas inside Fabric's notebook environment.

## üß™ Workflow Summary

1. Uploaded Excel files to Fabric workspace
2. Used Fabric Notebook to:
   - Load and merge monthly orders
   - Clean and standardize columns
   - Normalize tables using joins and groupings
3. Output results for downstream Power BI analysis (not included here)

## üì∏ Screenshots

To help illustrate key functionality and visuals, this project includes a `screenshots/` directory with example images of:

- Data preview displays (e.g., combined DataFrame view)
- Data cleaning steps in action
- Notebook UI and output snippets

You can view the screenshots directly in the `screenshots/` subfolder on GitHub or browse them using your local file explorer.
